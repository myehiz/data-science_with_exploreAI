**# Regression Sprint: Data Science Tech Track**

Welcome to the Regression Sprint repository! This repository contains code and materials related to the Regression module. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this sprint will help you dive into regression techniques and enhance your understanding of predictive modeling.

**# Syllabus**

**## 1. Module Overview: Regression**
- In this module, we delve into the realm of regression analysis, covering essential techniques and methodologies crucial for predictive modelling and data-driven decision-making. We start by exploring fundamental concepts such as linear regression and model performance evaluation, gradually progressing to more advanced topics like multiple linear regression, variable selection, regularisation, ensemble methods, and bootstrapping.

**## 2. An Introduction to Machine Learning**
- There are certain key concepts that are often used in conjunction with solving data science problems. In this lesson, we are going to explain some of these methods and approaches to help form the foundation for more complex concepts in the weeks to come. We‚Äôll first take a look at what is meant with machine learning, then look at predictive modelling, before examining the measures we can use to assess whether a model is performing well or not.

**## 3. Linear Models**
- Understanding linear models provides a foundation for regression analysis and predictive modelling. In this lesson, we delve into the basics of simple linear regression and its application in modelling the relationship between two variables to make predictions. We then look at the least squares method and how it is used to find the line of best fit. 

- Finally, we learn how to implement a linear regression model using Python's scikit-learn library, evaluate its performance and interpret the results. By the end of this lesson, you'll possess the skills to apply simple linear regression effectively for insightful data analysis.

**## 4. Model Performance**
- Predictive models are useful tools that guide decision-making and forecast future trends. However, to ensure that our models are reliable and can deliver real-world value, we must thoroughly evaluate them to identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement.

- In this lesson, we will explore the various aspects of evaluating model performance such as the metrics and challenges that underpin this evaluation. We will also look at how to assess a model‚Äôs ability to generalise to new data and why this is an important indicator of a model‚Äôs real-world performance.

**## 5. Multiple Linear Regression**
- Understanding multiple linear regression and its evaluation metrics is crucial, as it provides a powerful tool for uncovering relationships within data and making predictions. Multiple linear regression serves as the cornerstone for various advanced machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques, and is often used in fields such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and engineering.

- In this lesson, we will cover the fundamentals of multiple linear regression, including its assumptions, implementation in Python using libraries like sklearn and statsmodels, and evaluation techniques. We'll explore how to check for linearity, multicollinearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality, and outliers in regression models.

**## 6. Variable Selection and Model Persistence**
- Variables are the building blocks of machine learning models, and all contribute to and affect the model building process differently. Variable selection is necessary as it aims to improve model performance, speeding up model training, and reduce computational costs. In this lesson, we will examine variable selection techniques, and how to apply them to select the most informative features for our models.

- We will also look at how to effectively save a trained machine learning model and load it for future use, ensuring it can be embedded into real-world systems, shared, or deployed without the need to retrain.


**## 7. Regularization**
- Regularisation is an important element in data science, used to create models that generalise well and can predict accurately on unseen data. It's a critical defence against overfitting, ensuring models remain adaptable and reliable.

- In this lesson, we'll unravel the mechanics and benefits of regularisation methods, including ridge and LASSO regression. We‚Äôll delve into the intricacies of data scaling, overfitting, and the strategic application of regularisation to enhance model performance in real-world data science scenarios.

**## 8. Decision Trees**
- Understanding decision trees and their implementation is crucial for anyone interested in machine learning and data analysis. Decision trees provide a simple, yet powerful, tool for both classification and regression tasks, allowing us to interpret and visualise complex decision-making processes.

- In this lesson, we will delve into the fundamentals of decision trees, exploring how they work, how to train them effectively, and how to implement them using Python libraries like sklearn. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, practical examples, and hands-on coding exercises, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of decision trees and their application in real-world scenarios.

- Random forests and applying our knowledge
We have previously looked at ensemble learning where we combine multiple models to improve overall performance. In this lesson, we look at an application of this concept, the random forest, which leverages the collective strength of multiple decision trees to produce more accurate results. We will examine how random forests work and how to apply them in Python.

- In this lesson, we also apply the knowledge we have acquired in the earlier weeks by going through the process of evaluating a dataset from scratch and testing various modeling methods to solve a regression problem.

**## 9. Ensemble Methods and Bootstrapping**
- In the ever-evolving field of data science, ensemble methods stand out as a powerful strategy to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models. These techniques involve combining multiple models to form a stronger, more accurate prediction model. The rationale behind this approach is grounded in the wisdom of crowds theory, which suggests that the aggregate of multiple predictions will often be more accurate than individual predictions.

- This lesson delves into ensemble methods and bootstrapping, crucial techniques for anyone looking to enhance their machine learning skills. By mastering these methods, data scientists can significantly improve the robustness, accuracy, and generalisability of their predictive models, addressing some of the most challenging problems in data science today.


**## 10. Decision Tree Code Challenge**
- In this code challenge, we will test our knowledge of the fundamental concepts of decision trees by implementing a decision tree regression model and analysing its RMSLE.

**## 11. Regression MCQ**
- In this MCQ, we will engage in a comprehensive multiple-choice exercise, applying regression concepts and techniques to agricultural yield prediction.

- Through a series of challenges, we'll analyse variable relationships, feature engineering, model construction, and evaluation, enhancing our understanding and proficiency in regression analysis.
